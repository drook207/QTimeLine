# This is the config file that the pre-commit hook for codespell as well as manual codespell executions will run.
# Note that some of the skip options here are doubled: for example `src/libs/j1939/j1939.qmodel,./src/libs/j1939/j1939.qmodel`.
# As you can see, once it is in the skip list with a relative path using a `./` and once without. This is a workaround to some
# apparently present bug in codespell, where the skip list is handled differently when codespell is called from the pre-commit
# framework than when called by hand. You can read more in that issue: https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell/issues/3306
